# Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning Course Challenges
This project is a submission for two challenges from the Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning course.

## Image Classification
### Introduction
In this homework you are required to classify species of plants (like the ones in the example image below), which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

## Time Series Classification
### Introduction
In this homework, you are asked to correctly classify samples in the multivariate time series format. In other words, since this is a classification problem, the objective is to correctly map the information contained in the features calculated over time to their labels.
